# movie-search-app

An app using the OMDB API to search for a movie to get the info on it.

## Features

- You can search a movie by name and a list will show up relating to the search
- When you view more info, you can see more detailed info on the movie like Writers, Ratings, Directors, etc.
  - You can alo go right to the IMDB page of the movie from this page as well.

## Note

- I created this project by following the tutorial of (Brad Traversy's Video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsPqjYGauns&t=1505s&index=10&list=WL]
- I wanted to follow this tutorial so I can get more practice with APIs.
